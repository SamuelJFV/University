# These projects were made during my time in university

## Projects:

1) Conway's Game of Life (a cellular automaton) in Javascript and HTML.

2) A library to create and visualize structures of graphs in Python to solve a maximum matching problem.

3) A very robust Python script where it is possible to train a simple deep neural network to recognize hand-written number digits.
